# IndieCure
 A HoloCure inspired game with its own twist.. IndieCure is the internal name and won't be the final name



Current FileStructure plan:
- World specific resources in Scene specific folder.
- Global stuff that can be reused in the root folder in their respected folders

example:
Tab UI system is global and is found in the Scripts/UI folder
Background shader for the main menu is found in Worlds/MainMenu/Shaders
